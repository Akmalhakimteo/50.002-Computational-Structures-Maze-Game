Contributers: Shang Zewen

Task: Create A maze game that uses MOJO Hardware Description Language.

Game Idea: 
Players(as Theseus) must navigate through a maze (displayed by an 8 X 8 LED Matrix) to kill the Minotaur. But beware,
there are three levels to the maze and the maze is filled with a toxic gas, disrupting Theseus' vision. (the LED Matrix will 
display less of the maze at each level).

Lessons learnt through the project:
-How to 'think' like a machine
-How to display Software code into Hardware
-State Machines
